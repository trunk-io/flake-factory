### Welcome

This repository is designed to generate flaky test results. Many of the tests are written poorly with intent
to flake. 

### Demonstrated testing frameworks

### Mission

Our goal is to make engineering faster, more efficient and dare we say - more fun. This repository
will hopefully allow our community to share ideas on the best tools and best practices/workflows to
make everyone's job of building code a little bit easier, a little bit faster, and maybe in the
process - a little bit more fun. Read more about [Trunk Flaky](https://trunk.io/flaky-tests).
